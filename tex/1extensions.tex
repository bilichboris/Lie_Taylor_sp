In this section we provide a tool for computing spectrum of some modules by induction.

Let $\lieh$ be an arbitary Lie algebra. By one-dimensional extension of $\lieh$ we call the exact
sequence of Lie algebras
\[
    0 \to \CC_\lambda\rightarrow \lieg \xrightarrow\pi \lieh \to 0,
\]
where $\CC_\lambda$ is one-dimensional $\lieh$-module, such the commutator in $\lieg$ is given by
$[g,c] = \lambda(\pi(g))c$ for all $g in \lieg$ and $c \in \CC_\lambda$.  The fundamental result of
Lie algebra cohomology theory states, that isomorphism classes of such extensions are in one-to-one
correspondence with the set $H^2(\lieg,\CC_\lambda) = \Ext^2_{U\lieh}(\cmpl, \cmpl_\lambda)$.
